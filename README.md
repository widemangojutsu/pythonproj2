# Final-Project-Statistical-Modelling-with-Python

## Project/Goals
Test correlations between variables and determine relationship between them if sufficient for modeling.

## Process
Connect to Api
Parse APi and arrange into dataframes
returning dataframes and columns to prepare for model
correlation tests
model output

## Results
The results of the api's were insufficient in determing a strong relationship between the api's.

## Challenges 
I found navigating through dictionaries a little challenging this project
Hitting api rate limits can really put a stop to things.
Threading or pararellization would help speed up things

## Future Goals
Do more regression analysis on the variables and see if there if there is any possible 
determing number of bikes to high rated restaurants
